These html files all contain challenges from _*Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code*_ or their _*Algorithm Challenge*_ or the _*10 Days of JavaScript*_.  To see what the files succeed in doing you must view the Inspection area looking under Console.  All are just a method that does one job.

I have used Javascript in all but three files.  Those three files all contained in *30 Days of Code*, are written in Java since JavaScript was not an offered language to write in.
